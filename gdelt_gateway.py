Asifah Analytics -- GDELT Gateway
v2.3.1 -- September 21 2026  |  portable, drop into any backend

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT v1.0 GOT RIGHT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Serialising and pacing GDELT access was correct and stays untouched. The
backend really was competing with itself, and one request in flight per
process really was the fix.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT v1.0 GOT WRONG -- THE LOCKOUT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
A live ME scan on Sep 19 2026 produced an hour of this and nothing else:

    [GDELT Gateway] military/ara: circuit open, 114s remaining -- skipping
    [GDELT Gateway] me/heb:       circuit open, 113s remaining -- skipping
    [GDELT Gateway] military/ukr: circuit open,  92s remaining -- skipping
    ... several hundred more, across 16 language variants

Not one request reached GDELT. The circuit had latched permanently.

THE MECHANISM, exactly:

  1. Four consecutive failures set consecutive_fail = 4, which is
     FAILURE_CIRCUIT, so the circuit opened for CIRCUIT_COOLDOWN.
  2. Every call during the cooldown hit this early return:

         if _now() < _state['circuit_open_until']:
             _state['circuit_skips'] += 1
             return []

     which does NOT touch consecutive_fail. The counter stayed at 4.
  3. When the cooldown expired, the next call went through with the
     counter STILL at 4. One failure took it to 5, which is >= 4, so the
     circuit reopened immediately for another 300 seconds.
  4. Repeat forever.

The only escape was a single success landing on the one attempt allowed
per five minutes, or a process restart. consecutive_fail was also cleared
by reset_cycle() -- which no caller has ever imported.

THE COST, traced end to end:

    GDELT locks out
      -> every tracker sees 0 GDELT articles
      -> 'news_index_total < 60' and '(gdelt + newsapi) < 10' are always
         true, so the Brave FALLBACK fires as a PRIMARY on every scan
      -> ~460 Brave queries/day against a 6,000/month plan
      -> Brave 402s on Sep 12; seven days dark before anyone noticed
      -> corpus silently collapses from 7 sources to 3

One unreset counter. A month of degraded data and a spent API budget.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE v2.0 FIX
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  * PROPER HALF-OPEN -- when the cooldown expires the breaker enters
    half-open and admits exactly ONE probe. Success closes it and clears
    the counter; failure reopens it. The state is explicit instead of
    being inferred from a counter that nothing resets.
  * AUTO CYCLE RESET -- a gap longer than CYCLE_IDLE_SEC between calls is
    a new scan cycle: the interval relaxes and the failure count clears,
    with no caller change required. reset_cycle() still works for anyone
    who wants to be explicit. Five repos call this gateway; a fix that
    needed all five edited would not have been a fix.
  * QUIET SKIPS -- an open breaker logged once per call, which is how one
    hour of logs became several hundred identical lines and hid the
    actual failures. It now logs on transition and then periodically.
  * OBSERVABLE -- gateway_stats() reports the breaker state, how many
    times it has opened, and the last real error. It already existed and
    was never wired to an endpoint; there is a note below on doing that.

DOCTRINE: absence-honest. When GDELT genuinely fails the gateway returns
empty and says so in its stats. It never fabricates, and it never lets a
caller mistake "we throttled ourselves" for "the world went quiet" --
which is the same class of error as reading a dead RSS feed as regional
calm. v1.0 was honest about the empty result and silent about the reason,
which turned out to be the more expensive half.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
v2.1 -- THE BACKOFF WITH AMNESIA
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
A 429 raised `interval` to BACKOFF_INTERVAL "for the rest of the cycle".
But CIRCUIT_COOLDOWN is 300s and CYCLE_IDLE_SEC is 120s, so every breaker
cooldown was read as a new cycle, which reset `interval` to the floor. The
backoff could not survive the event that raised it. Sep 20: 36 rate-limited
responses, interval_now still 1.0. Fixed with throttled_until, which has
its own clock.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
v2.3 -- THE SAME MISTAKE, ONE FUNCTION DOWN
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
v2.2 hung the call budget off _maybe_new_cycle() -- the same unreliable
signal. Sep 20, one scan: calls=139 with budget_left=150, which is
arithmetically impossible unless the budget reset mid-scan. It did, every
time the breaker cooled down. 139 calls got through a 150-call budget and
rate_limited went from 36 to 67. A limit whose clock someone else winds
is not a limit.

v2.3 gives the budget its own window (BUDGET_WINDOW_SEC), independent of
cycles, breakers and idle gaps.

v2.3 also adds SPEND ATTRIBUTION. The gateway has always seen a `label` on
every call -- me/ara, humanitarian/eng, commodity/brave, oman/fas -- and
never counted by it. Sep 20 measured 609 DISTINCT queries in one scan, so
the cache cannot help and the budget can only ration. The query set has to
come down, and spend_by_label is what turns that from guesswork into a
list of which module is asking for what.

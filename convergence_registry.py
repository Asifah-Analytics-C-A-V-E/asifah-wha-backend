  ASIFAH ANALYTICS — CONVERGENCE REGISTRY
  v1.1.0 (May 23 2026)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Single source of truth for cross-axis / cross-regional convergence narratives.

A "convergence" is a compound risk that emerges only when two or more
otherwise-independent signals fire simultaneously. The textbook example:

  - Country has active humanitarian crisis (Lebanon: 1M displaced, food insecurity)
  - Global commodity is in pressure surge (wheat: Black Sea grain corridor stress)
  - Country has structural import dependency on that commodity (Lebanon: 80% Black Sea wheat)
    → CONVERGENCE: humanitarian crisis × commodity surge × import dependency

This module is consumed by TWO layers of the analytical stack:

LAYER 2 — me_regional_bluf.py (and equivalents for other regions later):
  - Enriches existing humanitarian/stability signals with convergence context
  - Adds compound-risk language to the long_text of the trigger signal
  - Sets the {convergence_id}_active boolean flag on the signal for Layer 1 to read

LAYER 1 — global_pressure_index.py:
  - Detects convergence flags on signals flowing through regional BLUFs
  - Emits a NEW high-priority Tier-1 narrative for the convergence itself
  - Cross-regional tagging gives it +30 boost in synthesis ordering

ADDING A NEW CONVERGENCE:
  1. Append a dict to CONVERGENCE_REGISTRY below
  2. Verify the trigger_signal_category exists in the relevant regional BLUF
  3. Verify the commodity exists in commodity_tracker.COMMODITY_TYPES
  4. Deploy ME backend (both BLUF + GPI live there) — that's it

REQUIRED FIELDS per convergence entry:
  id                       — unique snake_case identifier (also used as category)
  commodity                — must match commodity_tracker COMMODITY_TYPES key
                             (use None for non-commodity-anchored convergences)
  country                  — primary country name for display + matching
  trigger_signal_category  — category string Layer 2 watches for in BLUF
  trigger_region           — which regional BLUF carries the trigger
                             (recognized: 'me', 'asia', 'europe', 'wha', 'africa')
  commodity_threshold      — min alert level: 'elevated', 'high', or 'surge'
  regions                  — list of regions for cross-regional Tier-1 boost
  priority                 — narrative priority (10-15 range)
  icon                     — emoji
  color                    — hex color
  headline_template        — supports {alert} placeholder for commodity status
  detail                   — static prose body
  facts                    — dict of structured anchors (display + audit)
  enrichment_text_template — Layer 2 long_text append (supports {alert}, {signals})

OPTIONAL FIELDS:
  trigger_signal_min_level — only fire if trigger signal is at this level or higher
  notes                    — analyst notes (not displayed)

    # PALESTINIAN FINANCIAL ACCESS CLUSTER  (Oct 3 2026)
    # ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # The cluster doctrine above says siblings are kept separate because the
    # same shock LANDS DIFFERENTLY. That is this lane's entire argument:
    # correspondent-banking failure is PLUMBING -- trade finance and
    # remittances freeze even if the PA is solvent -- while clearance
    # withholding is a POLITICAL ACT that hits payroll directly. Collapsing
    # them would produce one blurred reading that cannot tell a banking
    # crisis from a coercion decision.
    #
    # SCHEMA NOTE, stated rather than hidden: 'commodity' here is
    # 'financial_access', which is not a traded good. The registry's actual
    # logic is "a country depends on an externally controlled supply, and
    # that supply is under stress" -- and Palestinian dependence on
    # Israeli-controlled shekel clearing is a supply dependency in every
    # sense that matters. The field is used as intended even though the
    # word was chosen for wheat.
    #
    # The 'country' on each entry is where the failure LANDS, not where the
    # decision is taken. Clearance withholding is decided in Jerusalem and
    # lands on the PA; reconstruction conditionality is decided in the Board
    # of Peace and lands in Gaza.
    #
    # ALERT MAPPING: the lane states from rhetoric_tracker_israel

    # onto the registry's normal/elevated/high/surge ladder via
    # financial_access_alert() below, so the existing threshold machinery
    # works unchanged.

# CLUSTERS (Sep 20 2026)
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# A cluster groups sibling convergences that share a commodity and a
# region but differ in how the shock LANDS. It gives the GPI a way to say
# "three of four Levant wheat nodes are firing" instead of naming the same
# single country every cycle -- which is what it has done since May,
# because wheat_lebanon is one of the only entries whose trigger was ever
# actually wired.
#
# Entries without a 'cluster' key simply do not participate.

# v1.2.0 (Oct 6 2026) -- CLUSTERS CARRY THE BUTTERFLY.
#
# Until now a cluster was a display string and nothing more, so cluster_status()
# could say "2 of 4 nodes firing" and could NOT say what 2 of 4 leads to. That
# second clause is the whole point of a cluster: four Levant wheat nodes do not
# produce four butterflies, they produce one compounding regional one.
#
# A cluster may now be either a plain string (legacy, still valid -- every
# consumer below normalises) or a dict with these keys:
#
#   label            display name. Required.
#   shared_mechanism the physical path the shock travels. ONE sentence.
#   why_together     what makes these nodes one story rather than N stories.
#   compounding      what N nodes means that 1 node does not. The actual
#                    analytic claim, and the one that must not overreach.
#   transmission     per-node: how the SAME shock lands differently here.
#                    Keyed by entry id. This is the richest field, because the
#                    Levant nodes fail through genuinely different mechanisms.
#   butterfly        downstream exposure, the exposure-surface shape one
#                    altitude up. Roles and observables, never tickers.
#   not_implied      explicit non-claims. The doctrine guard.
#   as_of            date-stamped, so staleness is visible rather than assumed.
#
# EVERY field except `label` is optional and absent means absent -- cluster_status
# omits what is not written rather than emitting an empty string, so a half-filled
# cluster reads as half-filled instead of as a thin finding.

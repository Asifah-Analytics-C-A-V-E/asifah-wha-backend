========================================
U.S. SIGNAL INTERPRETER (v1.2.0 -- September 7, 2026)
========================================
Analytical layer for the US Rhetoric Tracker. Where the engine collects raw
signals, this module makes them MEAN something.

v1.1 ADDS: KINETIC-PRECURSOR CADENCE DETECTION
  Recognizes the structural pattern of US executive sequencing toward kinetic
  action against a foreign target. The Venezuela January 2026 raid was preceded
  by a 21-day cadence: intel disclosure → DOJ indictment → congressional warning
  → capability disclosure → "pretext" language. When the same cadence repeats
  against a new target (e.g., Cuba May 2026 — Ratcliffe Havana visit, Castro
  indictment, Hegseth congressional testimony, 300 drones disclosure, "pretext
  for military action" language), it is the highest-confidence pre-kinetic
  indicator available via OSINT.

  CRITICAL: stays APOLITICAL. Detects the PATTERN, not political content.
  Same logic regardless of administration. Cadence detection is a tradecraft
  observation, not editorial judgment.

v1.2 ADDS: THE CAPABILITY-RHETORIC JOIN
  Signal 7 has always told a human to go cross-reference the military tracker
  by hand. That instruction is now code. The military tracker writes a SIGNED
  capability read to Redis; this module sets it against measured rhetoric
  intensity. Rhetoric without capability is posturing; rhetoric against
  FALLING capability is the gap.

EXPORTS (v1.2):
  compute_top_signals(actor_results, articles, cross_theater_fps, capability=None) -> list
  compute_so_what_factor(actor_results, composite, outbound_targets, capability=None) -> dict
  compute_capability_rhetoric_gap(actor_results, capability) -> dict           [NEW v1.2]
  compute_branch_divergence_score(actor_results) -> float
  compute_domestic_fracture_score(actor_results, articles) -> float
  compute_escalation_cadence_score(actor_results, articles, target) -> dict    [NEW v1.1]
  compute_kinetic_precursor_targets(actor_results, articles) -> list           [NEW v1.1]

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
  1. APOLITICAL FRAMING. Never editorialize about whose rhetoric is "correct" —
     report VOLATILITY and DIVERGENCE, not partisan judgment.
  2. SO WHAT. Every metric must answer "why does this matter for stability?"
     in plain language a Foreign Service Officer would write.
  3. CROSS-SPECTRUM TRANSPARENCY. Always note when our signals lean partisan
     and how we're balancing them.
  4. CONCRETE OVER ABSTRACT. "ICE raid in Atlanta sparked 4-hour standoff"
     is better than "civil unrest indicators elevated."
  5. [v1.1] STRUCTURAL PATTERN OVER POLITICAL CONTENT. Cadence detection
     observes WHAT executive branches do when sequencing toward kinetic
     action, regardless of WHO is in office or WHY they're doing it.

# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# CAPABILITY-RHETORIC GAP (v1.2) -- THE JOIN
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Signal 7 of this module has, since it was written, instructed a human to
# "cross-reference against the Asifah Military Tracker fingerprint for
# actual fleet/troop movements. Rhetoric without movement = posturing;
# rhetoric with movement = preparation."
#
# That instruction is now code.
#
# The military tracker writes military:{actor}:capability_direction to
# Redis every scan, carrying a SIGNED read of whether that actor's
# capability is being applied or spent. The rhetoric tracker reads it and
# sets it against measured rhetoric intensity. Neither sensor can see this
# on its own. That is the whole point.
#
#   RHETORIC   CAPABILITY   READ
#   high       rising       credible buildup
#   high       flat         declaratory / deterrence signaling
#   high       FALLING      THE GAP
#   low        rising       quiet preparation (the most serious cell)
#   low        flat         baseline
#   low        falling      retrenchment
#
# APOLITICAL, consistent with the rest of this module: it measures whether
# declared posture is matched by measured capability. It does not judge
# whether either is correct.
#
# ABSENCE-HONEST: when the military read is stale, thin, or missing, this
# says so and refuses to name a cell. A confident wrong cell is worse than
# an admitted gap in coverage.
